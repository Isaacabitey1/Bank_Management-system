THE LOGIC BEHIND THIS PROGRAM/PROJECT

This program/Bank Management System is focused on a concept to generate and maintain daily payment transactions with the client's/customer’s account. Before getting into the main system, a user need to pass through login system to get access, then only he/she can use all the features of the system which includes Adding, Removing, Updating and viewing records, withdraw and deposit cash feature, check details of existing customers and another one is ATM feature.

Talking about the features of Bank Management System, while entering customer’s record he/she needs to provide the current date, account number, name, date of birth, age, address, valid ID number, phone number, the amount deposited while creating an account and select account type. Under the account type, there are five types, #Saving, #Current, #Fixed(for 1 year), #Fixed(for 2 years), #Fixed(for 3 years). But while updating customer’s information from existing account, he/she can only change address and phone number. There are two methods to check a user’s account in detail, thus, by Account number or by Account name. The other listing record displays customer’s name with an Account number, address and contact detail.

Generally transaction done through a bank is either by Depositing or Withdrawing amounts. So here the user can use both of the features easily. Whenever a user wants to withdraw or deposit some amount of money he/she needs to provide the Amount, then the system automatically maintain his/her Transaction record with total bank balance. And another thing is that while checking a client's/customer’s account in detail the system will display a bank interest information. This system calculates interest per month and displays to the user.

Another interesting feature is ATM. People use ATM in need so this bank management system contains the feature for easy management of both features using a single system. Before proceeding towards the ATM feature the user has to enter ATM pin code to get access. Here, he/she can check for Balance inquiry, deposit money and withdraw money. After accessing ATM features, the user just has to enter amount number while depositing or withdrawing amount.
